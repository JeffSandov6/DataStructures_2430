MOST ASSEMBLY LANGUAGES AND SOME LOW LEVEL LANGUAGES,SUCH AS BCPL BASIC COMBINED PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE,LACK BUILT IN SUPPORT FOR DATA STRUCTURES ON THE OTHER HAND,MANY HIGHLEVEL PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES AND SOME HIGHER LEVEL ASSEMBLY LANGUAGES,SUCH AS MASM,HAVE SPECIAL SYNTAX OR OTHER BUILT IN SUPPORT FOR CERTAIN DATA STRUCTURES,SUCH AS RECORDS AND ARRAYS FOR EXAMPLE,THE C A DIRECT DESCENDANT OF BCPL AND PASCAL LANGUAGES SUPPORT STRUCTS AND RECORDS,RESPECTIVELY,IN ADDITION TO VECTORS ONE DIMENSIONAL ARRAYS AND MULTIDIMENSIONAL ARRAYS 4 5
MOST PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES FEATURE SOME SORT OF LIBRARY MECHANISM THAT ALLOWS DATA STRUCTURE IMPLEMENTATIONS TO BE REUSED BY DIFFERENT PROGRAMS MODERN LANGUAGES USUALLY COME WITH STANDARD LIBRARIES THAT IMPLEMENT THE MOST COMMON DATA STRUCTURES EXAMPLES ARE THE C STANDARD TEMPLATE LIBRARY,THE JAVA COLLECTIONS FRAMEWORK,AND THE MICROSOFT NET FRAMEWORK CITATION NEEDED
MODERN LANGUAGES ALSO GENERALLY SUPPORT MODULAR PROGRAMMING,THE SEPARATION BETWEEN THE INTERFACE OF A LIBRARY MODULE AND ITS IMPLEMENTATION SOME PROVIDE OPAQUE DATA TYPES THAT ALLOW CLIENTS TO HIDE IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS OBJECTORIENTED PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES,SUCH AS C,JAVA,AND SMALLTALK,TYPICALLY USE CLASSES FOR THIS PURPOSE
MANY KNOWN DATA STRUCTURES HAVE CONCURRENT VERSIONS WHICH ALLOW MULTIPLE COMPUTING THREADS TO ACCESS A SINGLE CONCRETE INSTANCE OF A DATA STRUCTURE SIMULTANEOUSLY CITATION NEEDED
